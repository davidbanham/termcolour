# Wat do?
This is a little utility that will change between colour schemes in your xfce4 terminal.

To install it:

```
go install github.com/davidbanham/termcolour
```

To edit the colour schemes, edit ./termcolour.go and then reinstall it with `go install`

If you get the name of a colourscheme wrong it will be rude to you.
